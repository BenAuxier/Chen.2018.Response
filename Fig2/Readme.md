This folder contains the files used for Figure 2. 

The .fasta files are from the A4 genome assembly (GCA_001593145.1) and the bulk .sam files are from the combined reads of A4 
(SRR2726137, SRR2726139, SRR2726140). The single .sam files are of the single nuclei with the RG (Read Group) tag specifying the nucleus of origin.

The files are only for the regions spanning 100449-100562 for scaffold70 and 7340-847 for scaffold3570

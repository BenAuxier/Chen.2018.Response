These scripts and files were used to re-analyize the Chen et al., 2018 manuscript titled "Single nucleus sequencing reveals evidence of inter-nucleus recombination in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi"

The files to make each Figure are in their own folder. In this main folder can be found the python script that does the bulk of the work, this calculates the read depth using the pysam module.

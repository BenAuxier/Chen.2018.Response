These scripts and files were used to re-analyize the Chen et al., 2018 manuscript titled "Single nucleus sequencing reveals evidence of inter-nucleus recombination in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi"


This analysis is based on single-nucleus data from three isolates; A4, A5, and SL1. The analysis for each of these is in each folder.

The overall analysis and scripts can be found in the analysis folder
